 <h3>Core Collection Interfaces</h3>

<h4>Collection:</h4>
 the root of the collection hierarchy. A collection represents a group of objects known as its elements. The Collection interface is the base that all collections implement. 
Some types of collections allow duplicate elements, and others do not. Some are ordered and others are unordered. 

<h4>Set:</h4> A set cannot contain duplicate elements.

<h4>List: </h4>An ordered collection. Lists can contain duplicate elements. The user of a List generally automnomy over where in the list each element is inserted and can access elements by their index position. 


<h4>Map:</h4> An object that maps keys to values. A Map cannot contain duplicate keys, each key maps to a single value.
The last two core collection interfaces are merely sorted versions of Set and Map:

<h4>SortedSet:</h4> A Set that maintains its elements in ascending order. 
<h4>SortedMap:</h4> A Map that maintains its mappings in ascending key order. This is the Map analog of SortedSet. Sorted maps are used for naturally ordered collections of key/value pairs.
